After sorting data in "district summary" DataFrame we can see that we have total of 15 schools with 39,170 students, budget for all schools combined $24,649,428.00
Average Math Score is 78, Avarage Reading Score 82, % Passing Math score is 75, % Passing Reading 86, % Overall Passing 65.
This shows as just a general picture how is district doing but we have to dive dipper.
I created a DataFrame "School Summary" You can see that we precented with two types of schools District and Charter schools. 
Charter schools are segnificantly smaller than District schools by total of students.
Moving forward to our next analysys we can tell that Highest performing schools in a district are Charter schools and Buttom performing are District schools. 
Per stydent budget shows us that District schools spend more or same money per student.
Dosen't look like budgetting is impacting students passing rate.
Looks like school type impacts students performance the most.
Also when we take a look at "Spending summary" Schools wich spend per student <$580 have average Overall Passing score of 90%.
Schools with highest spending per student $645 - 680 have average Overall Passing score of 53%.
Small and medium schools have the highest Overall passing.
Charter schools have Overall passing score of 90% and District 53%.
To fully understand that the reason for better performance is a size of the school,
It would be usefull to recive addisional data on a sizes of the class.
